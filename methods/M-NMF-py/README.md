<p align="justify">
M-NMF is a network embedding algorithm which learns a clustering based on features extracted with modularity regularized non-negative matrix factorization. The procedure places nodes in an abstract feature space where the inner product of node features reconstructs a proximity based matrix representation of the graph. M-NMF has a quadratic runtime complexity in the number of nodes. This  specific implementation supports GPU use (Tensorflow).

A reference MatLab implementation is available [[here]](https://github.com/AnryYang/M-NMF).

### Requirements

The codebase is implemented in Python 3.5.2. Package versions used for development are just below.
```
networkx          1.11
tqdm              4.19.5
numpy             1.13.3
pandas            0.20.3
tensorflow-gpu    1.12.0
jsonschema        2.6.0
texttable         1.2.1
python-louvain    0.11
```

### Datasets

The code takes an input graph in a csv file. Every row indicates an edge between two nodes separated by a comma. The first row is a header. Nodes should be indexed starting with 0. A sample graph for the `Facebook Politicians` dataset is included in the  `data/` directory.

### Logging

The models are defined in a way that parameter settings and cluster quality is logged in every single epoch. Specifically we log the followings:

```
1. Hyperparameter settings.     We save each hyperparameter used in the experiment.
2. Cluster quality.             Measured by modularity. We calculate it in every epoch.
3. Runtime.                     We measure the time needed for optimization -- measured by seconds.
```

### Options

Learning of the embedding is handled by the `src/main.py` script which provides the following command line arguments.

#### Input and output options

```
  --input                STR         Input graph path.                                 Default is `data/food_edges.csv`.

### Examples

The following commands learn a graph embedding, cluster centers and writes them to disk. The node representations are ordered by the ID.

Creating an MNMF embedding of the default dataset with the default hyperparameter settings. Saving the embedding, cluster centres and the log file at the default path.

```
python src/main.py
```

Turning off the model saving.

```
python src/main.py --dump-matrices False
```

Creating an embedding of an other dataset the `Facebook Companies`. Saving the output and the log in a custom place.

```
python src/main.py --input data/company_edges.csv  --embedding-output output/embeddings/company_embedding.csv --cluster-mean-output output/cluster_means/company_means.csv
```

Creating a clustered embedding of the default dataset in 128 dimensions and 10 cluster centers.

```
python src/main.py --dimensions 128 --clusters 10
```
